The System Administrator or any user who wants to run this project does not have to worry about the nitty gritty details of it.

A module that ensures the smooth running of this project is provided, that is a manager module.

The user in point only needs to execute the manager.py module, and then he will be able to make full use of this project after configuring the network details. 

The network IP address, and subnet mask of this network needs to be noted in the active.py module. As mentioned in the report, the switches being used in the network need to have port mirroring functionality, and this feature needs to be configured so that the destination interface is the host where the manager module is executed.
